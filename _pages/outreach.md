**Psychology Undergraduate Research Community**\
(2022-current)
This research community is a collective of undergraduate and graduate psychology students that supports the teaching of the hidden curriculum of psychology research and academia. This includes help acquiring research positions, developing professional skills, applying to graduate school, and providing research presentation opportunities. Previously, I have served as a graduate mentor for multiple 5-week intensive programs helping students navigate applying for graduate school and undergraduate research projects. I also have served as a doctoral student judge at the inaugural symposium, facilitating sessions and assessing talk presentations from undergraduate students on their research. Currently, I am an Executive Coordinator, developing and facilitating weekly panels, workshops, and programs, as well as coordinating a team of graduate student volunteers.

**Summer Pyschology Research Initiative**\
(2022-2024)
This research initiative is an annual free 10-day intensive program targeted to high school students in Ontario from underrepresented groups (i.e. being a BIPOC, a first-generation student, and/or a gender minority), teaching about a broad range of psychology topics and research. The goal of this program is to promote diverse representation in the field of psychology, especially in higher education. Over the years, I have developed and delivered lectures on (1) writing in psychology, as well as (2) psychiatry and (3) clinical psychology research and careers. I have also served as an equity and diversity panelist discussing my experience navigating university as someone with invisible disabilities.

**neuroBRITE (Baycrest Research Innovation and Technology Education)**\
(2019-2020)
neuroBRITE was a neuroscience program for high school students, teaching about neuroscience and aging research with the opportunity to design, implement, and present their own projects. The overarching goal was to inspire high school students to develop science literacy skills and consider a career in science and technology, specifically related to the aging brain. The program was scheduled for February â€“ May 2020 and unfortunately had to be cancelled mid-way due to COVID-19. I served on the planning committee, which involved coordinating with multiple high schools, designing a lecture series, and organizing a hackathon and conference for students. I also developed a lecture for students on spatial navigation and memory processes.
