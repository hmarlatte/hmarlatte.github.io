I am completing my doctorate in the Department of Psychology at the University of Toronto, working at the Rotman Research Institute with [Dr. Asaf Gilboa](https://www.gilboalab.ca) and [Dr. Jennifer Ryan](https://drjenryan.com) (FOE May 2025). 

My research program focuses on how experiencing trauma and stress in adolescence and adulthood influence our ability to imagine, navigate, and explore new environments. I employ a variety of methods, including neuroimaging, eye tracking, heart rate monitoring, behavioral coding, and computational and qualitative narrative analysis to explore these effects in applied (e.g., occupational stress in police officers with [Dr. Judith Andersen](https://www.hartlab.net)) and clinical settings (e.g., individuals with post-traumatic stress disorder). Ultimately, my work aims to inform the development of therapeutic interventions to mitigate the long-term impact of traumatic stress and improve cognitive function across the lifespan. 

During my masters, I conducted basic science research on learning mechanisms in healthy young adults and patients with hippocampal amnesia with [Dr. Asaf Gilboa](https://www.gilboalab.ca).

In addition to my research, I am deeply committed to teaching, particularly in intersection of cognitive neuroscience and mental health and statistical methods. For example, I have independently designed and developed an undergraduate course on cognitive theories of mental health disorders (PSY 342: Cognition and Psychopathology), taught a fourth-year survey course on cognitive neuroscience and its methodologies several times (PSY493: Cognitive Neuroscience), and frequently assisted in teaching courses in both undergraduate and graduate level statistics. 

In my free time, you can find me baking with or without a recipe, drying flowers to later arrange, or knitting something in a nearby park or ravine.
